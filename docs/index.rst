Mekanik Corral (Mechanic Corral)
==========================================

Mekanik Corral is an attempt to build a game that meshes the action combat and
customization of the casual robot fighting genre (see Custom Robo for a great
example) with the collection and training aspects of a monster trainer like
Pok√©mon or Monster Rancher.

This is currently a fuzzy target so this design document is going to be a living
document as we explore the possibilities.
